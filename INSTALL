Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites
=============

Extempore has some library dependencies. 

On linux and OSX:
   - LLVM
   - pthread
   - pcre (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)
   - glfw (a light weight opengl lib)
   - glut

On linux you will also need:
   - portaudio
   - mesa GL (opengl)

On OSX you also need the following frameworks:
   - opengl
   - coreaudio
   - cocoa

Most of these  are pretty standard and you  will probably already have
them on your system (or they will be easy to install).  The three that
you are most likely to  need to download, compile and install yourself
are PCRE, GLFW and LLVM.  You can find them here:

   PCRE you can get from:
   http://www.pcre.org/

   GLFW you can get from:
   http://www.glfw.org/

   LLVM you can get from:
   http://www.llvm.org/

In all cases building from  the most recent source should "just work".
Also all three should build  fine with standard defaults.  So a simple
configure/make should be sufficient in all cases.

PCRE   and  GLFW   should  be   installed  in   the   usual  locations
(i.e. somewhere that gcc can find).

LLVM is  a special case  and currently has  it's own argument  for the
extempore build  script which  should just point  directly to  the top
level LLVM source directory.

Once all  of the library  dependencies for you platform  are installed
you can build extempore using the build.sh script.  It currently takes
two arguments, the  first tells whether to build  for "osx" or "linux"
and the second points to the top level llvm directory.

So to build on osx for example you would do something like this:

   $ . ./build.sh osx /Users/andrew/Documents/Code/llvm-2.8
   compiling for osx ...
   done

Voila ... you should be done.

Ubuntu GNU/Linux Installation
=============================

You'll need some dependencies:

   $ sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0 libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libglfw2 
     libglfw-dev glutg3 libglut3 libglut3-dev portaudio19-dev

For now you need to build LLVM from source (it will take some time):

   $ wget http://llvm.org/releases/2.8/llvm-2.8.tgz
   $ tar -xvzf llvm-2.8.tgz
   $ cd llvm-2.8/
   $ ./configure
   $ make

Now you can build Extempore:

   $ git clone https://github.com/digego/extempore.git
   $ cd extempore/
   $ sh build.sh linux <PATH TO YOUR LLVM DIRECTORY HERE>

Note you  should enter the  path where you  install LLVM. In  my case,
I've installed at /home/vilson/Misc/llvm-2.8.


NOTE: If you are running Ubuntu in VirtualBox (on OSX but also possibly
      on other hosts as well) then you will need to make a small
      source modification and then compile and install glfw manually.
      I haven't spent the time to investigate this properly but the
      following hack will fix it in the short term:

      The required source change is a one liner:
      	  uninstall any glfw packages that you have installed
	  download the glfw 2.7 source
          open the file glfw-2.7/lib/x11/x11_window.c
	  then search in the file for GLX_DRAWABLE_TYPE
	  comment out the body of the if statement
	  now compile and install as normal
      

Running
=======

To run extempore you need to pass  a single argument - the path to the
runtime directory.

For example:

   $ ./extempore `pwd`/runtime

Once you've started  extempore you can connect using  either Telnet or
Emacs (using the included extras/extempore.el file)

If  using  Telnet  the  default   extempore  port  to  connect  to  is
7099. Additionally extempore currently  takes a second argument (1 for
true) which  provides some additional banner information  which can be
useful for a Telnet session.

If you  want to  use Emacs you'll  need to  add the following  to your
~/.emacs file:

   (autoload 'extempore-mode "/path/to/extempore.el" "" t)

extempore.el can be found in the extras directory.
