;; multiple a * 5
;; note that type infercing works out the type 
;; of "a" and then using the inferred type
;; also works out the type of my-test-1
;; (i.e. argument type and return type)
;; 
;; integer literals default to 64 bit integers
(definec my-test-1
   (lambda (a)
      (* a 5)))

;; notice that the log view displays the type
;; of the closure we just compiled
;; [i64,i64]*
;; The square brackets define a closure type
;; The first type within the square braces is
;; the return type of the function (i64 for 64bit integer)
;; Any remaining types are function arguments 
;; in this case another i64 (for 64bit integer)
;; 
;; All closures are pointers.  Pointer types are
;; represented (as in "C") with a "*" which trails
;; the base type.
;; So an i64 pointer type would be "i64*"
;; A double pointer type would be "double*"
;; So a closure pointer type is "[...]*"

;; float literals default to doubles
(definec my-test-1f
   (lambda (a)
      (* a 5.0)))

;; Again note the closures type in the logview
;; [double,double]*


;; we can call these new closures like so
(print (my-test-1 6)) ;; 30
(print (my-test-1f 6.0)) ;; 30.0


;; you are free to recompile an existing compile
;; closures body to do something different whenever you like
;; so we can change my-test-1 to
(definec my-test-1
   (lambda (a)
      (/ a 5)))

(print (my-test-1 30)) ; 30 / 5 = 6

;; note that the closures signature is still the same
;; as it was before.  This is important because we are
;; NOT allowed to change an existing compiled closures
;; type signature.
;; 
;; So we CANNOT do this
(definec my-test-1
   (lambda (a)
      (/ a 5.0)))

;; Just remember that you are not currently allowed to redefine an 
;; existing function to a new definition that requres a different type signature.  
;; This is to protect against the situation where you have allready compiled
;; code which requires the current signature.


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; Because we are working with closures
;; we can close over free variables
;; in this example we close over power
;; to maintain state between calls
;;
;; increment power each call
(definec my-test-2
   (let ((power 0))
      (lambda (x)
         (set! power (+ power 1)) ;; set! for closure mutation as per scheme
         (* x power))))

;; each modifies state
(print (my-test-2 2)) ;; should = 2
(print (my-test-2 2)) ;; should = 4
(print (my-test-2 2)) ;; etc

               
;; Closures can of course return closures.
;; notice the type signature of this function
;; as printed in the logview "[[i64,i64]*]*"
;; being a closure that returns a closure
(definec my-test-3
   (lambda ()
      (lambda (x)
         (* x 3))))


;; let's try to make a generic incrementor
;;
;; here we run into trouble
;; because the type inferencer cannot infer a valid type 
;; for i or inc and therefore also cannot infer
;; a type for my-inc-maker!
;;
;; THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR!
(definec my-inc-maker
   (lambda (i)
      (lambda (inc)
         (set! i (+ i inc))
         i)))

;; This makes sense should "+" operate
;; on doubles or integers - who knows?
;; So the type inferencer complains justifiably complains
;;
;; What can we do about this ... 
;; we need to help the compiler out by proving some
;; explicit type goal posts
;;
;; We can do that by "typing" a variable.
;; Explicitly typing a variable means tagging
;; the symbol with a type separated by ":"
;;
;; Here are some examples
;; x:i64        = x is a 64 bit integer
;; y:double     = y is a double
;; z:i32*       = z is a pointer to a 32 bit integer
;; w:[i64,i64]* = w is a closure which takes an i64 and returns an i64
;;
;; Make sure there are no spaces in the expression
;;
;; Now we can explicitly type i
(definec my-inc-maker
   (lambda (i:i64)
      (lambda (inc)
         (set! i (+ i inc))
         i)))

;; this solves our problem as the compiler
;; can now use i's type to infer inc and
;; therefore my-inc-maker.


;; now we have a different problem.
;; if we call my-inc-maker we expect to be 
;; returned a closure.  But Scheme does not
;; know anything about ICR closure types and therefore
;; has no way of using the returned data.  Instead
;; it places the returned pointer (remember a closure is a pointer)
;; into a generic Scheme cptr type.
;;
;; We are free to then pass that cptr back into another
;; compiled function as an argument.  
;; 
;; So let's build a function that excepts a closure returned from 
;; my-inc-maker as an argument, as well as a suitable operand, and 
;; apply the closure.

;; f is our incoming closure
;; and x is our operand
;; THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
(definec my-inc-maker-wrappert
   (lambda (f x) ; f and x are args
      (f x)))

;; oops can't resolve the type of "f"
;; fair enough really.
;; even if we give a type for "x"
;; we still can't tell what "f"'s
;; return type should be?
;; This also causes an error!
(definec my-inc-maker-wrappert
   (lambda (f x:i64) ; f and x are args
      (f x)))

;; so we need to type f properly
(definec my-inc-maker-wrapper
   (lambda (f:[i64,i64]* x)      
      (f x)))

;; ok so now we can call my-inc-maker
;; which will return a closure
;; which scheme stores as a generic cptr
(define myf (my-inc-maker 0))

;; and we can call my-in-maker-wrapper
;; to appy myf
(print (my-inc-maker-wrapper myf 1)) ; 1
(print (my-inc-maker-wrapper myf 1)) ; 2
(print (my-inc-maker-wrapper myf 1)) ; 3 etc..

;; of course the wrapper is only required if you 
;; need interaction with the scheme world.
;; otherwise you just call my-inc-maker directly

;; this avoids the wrapper completely
(definec my-inc-test
   (let ((f (my-inc-maker 0)))
      (lambda ()
         (f 1))))

(print (my-inc-test)) ; 1
(print (my-inc-test)) ; 2
(print (my-inc-test)) ; 3

;; hopefully you're getting the idea.
;; note that once we've compiled something
;; we can then use it any of our new
;; function definitions.

;; direct access to a closures environment

;;
;; You do this using a dot operator
;; To access an environment slot you use

;; So for example
;; (f.a:i32)
;; would return the 32bit integer symbol 'a'
;; from the closure 'f'
;; 
;; To set an environment slot you just
;; add a value of the correct type
